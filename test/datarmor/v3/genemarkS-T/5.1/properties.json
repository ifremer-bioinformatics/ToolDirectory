  "NAME": "GeneMarkS-T",
  "DESCRIPTION": "Sets of assembled eukaryotic transcripts can be analyzed by the modified GeneMarkS algorithm (the set should be large enough to permit self-training). A single transcript can be analyzed by a special version of GeneMark.hmm with Heuristic models. A new advanced algorithm GeneMarkS-T was developed recently (manuscript sent to publisher).",

  "description": "PoPoolation2 allows to compare allele frequencies for SNPs between two or more populations and to identify significant differences. PoPoolation2 requires next generation sequencing data of pooled genomic DNA (Pool-Seq). It may be used for measuring differentiation between populations, for genome wide association studies and for experimental evolution.",

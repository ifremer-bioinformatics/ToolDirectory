  "description": "Method for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in the history of a set of populations. In the underlying model, the modern-day populations in a species are related to a common ancestor via a graph of ancestral populations. The allele frequencies in the modern populations are used to infer the structure of this graph.",

  "description": "Software of Inference of Quasispecies subjected to Recombination. We present a jumping hidden Markov model that describes the generation of the viral quasispecies and a method to infer its parameters by analysing next generation sequencing data. We offer an implementation of the EM algorithm to find maximum a posteriori estimates of the model parameters and a method to estimate the distribution of viral strains in the quasispecies.",

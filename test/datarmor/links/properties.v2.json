  "description": "LINKS (Long Interval Nucleotide K-mer Scaffolder) is a genomics application for scaffolding genome assemblies with long reads, such as those produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd. It can be used to scaffold high-quality draft genome assemblies with any long sequences (eg. ONT reads, PacBio reads, other draft genomes, etc). It is also used to scaffold contig pairs linked by ARCS/ARKS.",
